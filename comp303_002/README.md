# COMP303: Java EE

## Course Description

This course builds on Java Programming, COMP228, and covers Java EE APIs. Coursework emphasizes distributed objects, Java Web applications and Java enterprise applications for deployment to Java Application Servers. The course also covers using the Java Persistence API in Java SE and Java EE environments. Hands-on exercises use Eclipse and Wildfly 10.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:
- Explain how the runtime environments provided by Java Micro, Standard and Enterprise Editions are different
- Use the Java SE API for:
    - Miscellaneous programming
    - (collections, TCP/IP sockets, simple multi-threading, ...)
    - Apply design patterns such as the singleton
- Name tiers in the Java EE n-tier architecture and explain how Java Application Servers support distributed applications
    - Use several component types supported by Web and EJB containers
    - Describe services provided by the Web and EJB container

- Design, code and test Java Web applications based on
    - Basic Web Apps: Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)
    - Java Server Faces: Components library and HTML 5
- Apply design patterns such as MVC
    - Design and implement layered applications
- Package application components for deployment
    - Java archive (JAR)
    - Web archive (WAR)
    - Enterprise application archive (EAR) files.
- Explain the relationship between JEE deployment descriptor files and Java annotations
- Use the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) to
    - Provide a persistence layer that performs object-relational mapping
    - Access persistent data (relational databases) from application code
- Describe the role of Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) in Enterprise application Integration (EAI)
    - Use stateless session EJBs as facades for JPA entity beans
- Discuss factors for success in enterprise applications
    - Reliability, Scalability, Performance, Adaptability, Interoperability...
- Develop and package Java-based applications using
    - Eclipse for development
    - Wildfly (JBoss) application server for deployment
    - MySQL database server for persistence
