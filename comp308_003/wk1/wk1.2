installed nodejs v9.4.0

powershell
(gci env:path | select value) -split ';' | sls java

use yarn instead of bower (outdated now)

install git via desktop.github.com or git-scm.com

nodejs is very slim as a server, use npm to add functionality (dependencies to get our webapp to work)

node is everything going on in the backend

DON'T do:
$ npm install express --save

this is normally how we install packages though

express is an addon for nodejs

installed .ejs extension in vscode
and Angular 2 TypeScript Emmet

package.json keeps track of all dependencies for the package
    properties/manifest for all dependencies

npm init to create the package.json file

express is middleware...?

never push node_modules to github

nodemon is a helper, developer dependency, our app doesnt need it to run
$ npm install nodemon --save-dev
it helps us so that we dont need to stop and start server everytime make a change

get nodemon and mongod working...

nodejs essential training on lynda.com
