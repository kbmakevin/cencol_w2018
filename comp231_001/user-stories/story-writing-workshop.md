# Story-Writing Workshop
## Definition
- a story-writing workshop is a meeting that includes developers, users, the product customer and other parties who can contribute by writing stories (e.g. the team's Customer).
    - customer == business analyst on the team; understands business value of dev this system

## Story-Writing Workshop
- write as many stories as you can ("trawling" for stories)
- no priorities are associated w the stories at this point; the team's customer will havea chance to do that later (before planning a release)
- a team can hold additional workshops before each planned release but this is typically not necessary
- combines the best elemeents of brainstorming w low-fidelty prototyping

## Low-Fidelty Prortyping
- can be done either on a whiteboard, or software capable of creating flow chart diagrams
- maps very high lvl interactions w/in the planned software for each identified user role 
- prototype is built up iteratively during the workshop as the participants brainstorm the things a user may want to do at various points while using the application
- conceptual workflows are identified, not actual screens and fields
- depth-first approach
- maintain a parking lot of issues to come back to before or after the workshop
- do not get bogged down in lengthy debate over each story (focus on quantity rather than quality)
    - redudant stories can be removed or replaced by better quality stories later
    - when the team's customer prioritizes stories for a release, she can assign a low priority to low quality stories
- sometimes u get stuck during prototyping, it can be beneficial to have access to competitive or similar products
- pay attention to who is contribugin; encourage everyone to participate

## Questions to Ask During Low-Fidelty Prototyping
- whast will the user most likely want to do next?
- what mistakes could the user make here?
- what could confuse the user at this point?
- what additional info could the user need? to transition to another component?

- the notes inside of each user story card are for future conversation b/t the customer and developers
