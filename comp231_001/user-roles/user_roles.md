User Role
---
collection of defining attributes that characterize a population of users and intended interactions w the sys

informally...
    comprises of a grp of indiv that interact w a sys in a significantly diff way to that of other user roles (e.g. Administrator)
        note: user roles are singlular, not plural!

Why do it?
---
NOTE: user stories <=> functional requirements

practical and cost effective
    working w real users strongly improve likelihood delivery desired software
    however, impractical to get right users or right mix of users
    disciplines of usage-centered design/interaction design teach us the benefits of identifying user roles to writing user stories

How to Run a User Role Modeling Workshop
---
    introduce urselves before starting the Workshop
        have each person introduce him/herself and the role he/she is playing
        make sure the introduction is captured on video (for grading purpose)
    edit videos afterwards using either VLC player, mac's quicktime player

Four Steps to User Role Modeling
---
1.  Brainstorming an initial set of user roles
2.  Organizing the initial set
3.  Consolidating roles
4.  Refining the roles

Refining the Roles
---
Group roles by following categories:
    the frequency w which the user will use the software
    user's level of expertise within his/her domain
    user's general level of proficiency w computers and software
    user's level of proficiency w software being developed
    user's general goal for using the software 
        some after convenience, others favor rich experience, and so on.

e.g. User Role: Internal Recruiter
-
-   not particularly computer-savvy but quite adept at using the web
-   will use the software infrequently but intensely
-   will read ads from the other companies to figure out how to best word her ads
-   ease of use is important but more importantly what she learns must be easily recalled months later

A User Role is ONE User
---
when braininstorming for user roles, stick to identifying roles that represent a SINGLE user
    e.g. "A company can post a job opening"
        since a company as a whole cannot use the software, the story will be better if it refers to a role that represents an individual

System Roles
---
    try to stick with user roles that define people, as opposed to other systems
    don't need every conceivable user roles, only the ones who can make or break the success of the project
    other systems are rarely purchasers of our system
    there are execeptions, so if u feel that adding a non-human user role helps you think about the system, then add it
