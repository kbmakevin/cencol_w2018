Release Planning and Iteration Planning will begin on Feb 26, 2018.  Materials for Release Planning can be here and for Iteration Planning can be found here.

The Iteration Length will be 14 days long.  We have a total of two Iterations per Release and we have two Releases (i.e., we have a total of four Iterations). 

Iteration 1 will begin on Feb 26, 2018.  Thus, Release 1.0 will be due on March 25, 2018 at 11:59pm. 

Iteration 3 and Release 2.0 will be on March 26, 2018.  Release 2.0 will be due on April 22, 2018 at 11:59pm. 

Question for your team to determine: Given the above information regarding Iteration Length, when will Iteration 1 end and Iteration 2 begin?
