The Sunk Cost Fallacy. 
The Misconception: You make rational decisions based on the future value of objects, investments and experiences. The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

need to avoid ^ when dealing with projects; e.g. by projected end date only achieved 25% of scope, dont dump billions of $$ more


10 knowledge areas
47 processes
	in Project Managmeent

4 reasons why projects fail
	people
	processes
	technology
	organization

failure vs challenged
failure
	havent delivered value or did not meet requirements

challenged
	completed, over budgt or over time

when considering success or failure of a project ,we are only considering end results; disregarding methodologies
	e.g. traditional vs agile....we just look at the end results nd the expected scope;budget;scheduleand quality of the
 	     project

		so we dont consider success/failure after every deliverable for projects following agile methodology
