# Week 1
mov
measurable organizational value

we dont need PMI...it is only for those preparing for PMP exams

only ned the 5th ed textbook by Jack Marchewka
wiley - 4 device usage, $58/4

sponsor vs client
---
internal provides resources and asks u to do a project -> SPONSOR
external " " " -> CLIENT

time,money,resources, reputation (impacted from project)

project mangement body of knowledge
pmbok

A project
---
temporary endeavor
	must have start date, end date
	cannot continue indefinitely

unique result/product/service

vs

an operation
---
ongoing process follows organiations business processess

a project can create
---
product that can be either a component of another item, an enhancement of an item or an end item in itself;

a service or a capability to perform a service
	business function that supports production or distrubiton for example

an improvoemtn in the existing product/;service lines
	e.g. six sigma project undertaken to reduce defectgs

a result such as an outcome or document
	e.g. a research project that develops knowlege that can be usd to detemrine whether a trend exists or a new process will benefit society


Example
---
when i changed process of handling servers for rbc, that was a project
however when that became the norm for everyone to follow, that became an operaitons

ITSM
---
it service management system (e.g. serviceNow)

purpose synonymous with MOV (Measurable organizational value)

SME
eg hiring a lawyer for consultation when making a website (what is legal to be placed on the website)
area outside of IT

smes know the business logic, e.g. from a certain department, w could consult them for infor for that particular deptart,etnt

PM
doesnt need to be expert or from the particular field that he is in
just needs to be great at pm related activities
doesnt do any work at all, just spends communication with team to get the job done
	find out status from resources, any blockers, etc.

progresssive elaboration
---
as we proceed, we know more about the task at hand/project

planned org change
---
need to tell ppl about new sys, how changing will save them time, how it will benefit them...otherwise they wont even use the new product



Objectives of a Project
---
1.Scope
2.Schedule
3.Budget
4.Quality - optional


e.g. of Project Portfolio
---
1.IT Project
	portal
		registration



2.Non IT Project
	construction
		of aersopace building

	Parking

e.g. IT Project above is a PROGRAM (similar projects grouped together)

collection of all PROGRAMs is a PROJECT PORTFOLIO


portfolio-courses taken at cencol
program-grp of all network courses
project-some projects are indepdnt of any programs (no similarities with anything else)

EDP
eletronicn data processing
	data was not shared...islands of data between diff departments

erp
enterprise resource planning
	making one view of the data for everyone to see

crm
customer relationship managmeent
	know customer demographics, what they would buy etc

The Sunk Cost Fallacy. 
The Misconception: You make rational decisions based on the future value of objects, investments and experiences. The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

need to avoid ^ when dealing with projects; e.g. by projected end date only achieved 25% of scope, dont dump billions of $$ more


10 knowledge areas
47 processes
	in Project Managmeent

4 reasons why projects fail
	people
	processes
	technology
	organization

failure vs challenged
failure
	havent delivered value or did not meet requirements

challenged
	completed, over budgt or over time

when considering success or failure of a project ,we are only considering end results; disregarding methodologies
	e.g. traditional vs agile....we just look at the end results nd the expected scope;budget;scheduleand quality of the
 	     project

		so we dont consider success/failure after every deliverable for projects following agile methodology

---

# Week2
project life cycle
phases	
processes

Project Life Cycle
---
they are born, grown, peak, decline and then end
altho projec life cycles may differ depending on the industry o rproject, all proj life cycles will have a beginning, middle and an end

	

deliverable
any tangible or intangible outcome
e.g. project schedule (tangible)
     training for the user (intangible)

if after an evaluation, u know u will not finish the project by the projceted date, u can do 'fast tracking' to run phases in parallel

project/schedule compression (reducing the project schedule)
	risk arises if there are dependencies between phases of the project


5 phases of a project
---
1.define project goals
-
projects are organizational investments, need to define projects value right at the beginning to determine whether the project is worth doing

incentives for starting a project:
-strategic
-financial
-social
-operational
-etc.

2.plan project
-
do lots of planning i.e. change management, etc.
if u dont plan, u plan to fail

3.execute project plan
-
while executing, keep up to date with status of your team; monitoring

4.close project
-
lots of procesess goes into this 
covered in ch 12

5.evaluate project
-
how well/poorly did we do compared to our expectations?
done by auditor from outside the team
were legal stds followed?
expectations vs reality
document all of this and make it available in organization

NOTE: sdlc is included inside of the PLC because the project is included inside of the project life cycle

10 knowledge areas but in total we have 47 processes
MEMORIZE these 10 knowledge areas from the PMBoK


PMBoK Project Management Process Groups
---
process is defind a sa set of interrelated actions and activities performed to a chive a pre-specified proiduct, result or service

it may involve some kind of input as well as directions, tools or techniques to change the input to the esired output or result

1.initiating
	reach out to sponsors/clients; discuss requirements/specs so that when the project finishes, nothing comes as a surprise, they get what they are expecting to get
	brainstorming
	project proposal
	"murder board" ideas presented to them, murder board "murders" most of the ideas, accepts one or two proposals


2.planning

3.Executing

4.Monitoring and Controlling
if work being done ahead/behind schedule both are concerns
	done ahead of schedule, concern, gray area
		b/c either ur planning/estimates were wrong or someone is cutting corners; lower quality of work


5.Closing
releasing resources (tech, employees, etc.)
evaluating the project
updating all documents
	maintenance, system, user, etc.
	good practice is to start documenting right from the beginning though

NOTE: these same 5 processes are applied to EACH of the process groups, see slide 12 diagram


Product Oriented Processes
---
1.For an IT project, this would be all the processes requried to design, build, test, document , and implement an applciation system


Project: Product, System, Service, etc.

Project lifecycle has 5 phases: iniating, planning, executing, monitoring, closing

Product Life Cycle: design, coding, testing, deploying and maintenance

2.There must be a balance b/t proj managmenet processes and product-oriented processes in order to deliver a succsefl project

PRoject IN Controlled Envionrment


just know there are two methodologies, one from PMBoK, the other from PRINCE
we only need to focus on PMBoK one though for this course

agile
---
delivers value even if the sys does not include all of the defined requirements

*skip agile manifetso

sprint = 5-7 weeks, working version of the project will be releasd

team learning
---
speed
# of learning cycles completed

depth
degree to which a team can deepen its undertstanding of the proj from cycl eto cycle

breadth
impact the project has on the organization

---
# Week3
ch2 review
---
decisions and actions taken in one knowledge area at a certain time rarely affect other knowledge areas
FALSE, anything that changes in one area affects all other knowledge areas

TRUE, level of activity and length of each process grp varies for every project

TRUE, executing grp generally requires the most resources

projets with inexperienced and disperesed teams are compatible with the use of agile approach...

# MOV and the Business Case
- vision: where u want to be
- mission: how to get there
- strategies: tools used to move ur mission
    - they are all connected, support one another

e.g. Cencol
- vision: Academic Excellence in 5 years
- MIssion: how to get there
- Strategies: Campus based learning, Online based learning, Students Engagement, Faculty

## Good Goal
1. Measurable       -> Landing a man on Moon and returning him safely to Earth
2. Provide Value    -> Made it to the moon (pride of country vs others ex. russia)
3. Be agreed upon   -> Kennedy and NASA
4. Be verifiable    -> 

---

# Week4
- triple constraints
- NOTE: for business case, planning phase requires more resources than developing
    - this is contrary to the actual product development of a project
- projectitus...
    - ppl become emotionally/socially dependent on one another..when project ends they fear they will no longer be able to maintain their relationships
        - disadv. ppl may intentionally delay the proj to stay together
    - adv. specialists, knoweledgeable
-
