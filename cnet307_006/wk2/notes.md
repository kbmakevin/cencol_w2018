Project Life Cycle
---
they are born, grown, peak, decline and then end
altho projec life cycles may differ depending on the industry o rproject, all proj life cycles will have a beginning, middle and an end
	

deliverable
any tangible or intangible outcome
e.g. project schedule (tangible)
     training for the user (intangible)

if after an evaluation, u know u will not finish the project by the projceted date, u can do 'fast tracking' to run phases in parallel

project/schedule compression (reducing the project schedule)
	risk arises if there are dependencies between phases of the project


5 phases of a project
---
1.define project goals
-
projects are organizational investments, need to define projects value right at the beginning to determine whether the project is worth doing

incentives for starting a project:
-strategic
-financial
-social
-operational
-etc.

2.plan project
-
do lots of planning i.e. change management, etc.
if u dont plan, u plan to fail

3.execute project plan
-
while executing, keep up to date with status of your team; monitoring

4.close project
-
lots of procesess goes into this 
covered in ch 12

5.evaluate project
-
how well/poorly did we do compared to our expectations?
done by auditor from outside the team
were legal stds followed?
expectations vs reality
document all of this and make it available in organization

NOTE: sdlc is included inside of the PLC because the project is included inside of the project life cycle

10 knowledge areas but in total we have 47 processes
MEMORIZE these 10 knowledge areas from the PMBoK


PMBoK Project Management Process Groups
---
process is defind a sa set of interrelated actions and activities performed to a chive a pre-specified proiduct, result or service

it may involve some kind of input as well as directions, tools or techniques to change the input to the esired output or result

1.initiating
	reach out to sponsors/clients; discuss requirements/specs so that when the project finishes, nothing comes as a surprise, they get what they are expecting to get
	brainstorming
	project proposal
	"murder board" ideas presented to them, murder board "murders" most of the ideas, accepts one or two proposals


2.planning

3.Executing

4.Monitoring and Controlling
if work being done ahead/behind schedule both are concerns
	done ahead of schedule, concern, gray area
		b/c either ur planning/estimates were wrong or someone is cutting corners; lower quality of work


5.Closing
releasing resources (tech, employees, etc.)
evaluating the project
updating all documents
	maintenance, system, user, etc.
	good practice is to start documenting right from the beginning though

NOTE: these same 5 processes are applied to EACH of the process groups, see slide 12 diagram


Product Oriented Processes
---
1.For an IT project, this would be all the processes requried to design, build, test, document , and implement an applciation system


Project: Product, System, Service, etc.

Project lifecycle has 5 phases: iniating, planning, executing, monitoring, closing

Product Life Cycle: design, coding, testing, deploying and maintenance

2.There must be a balance b/t proj managmenet processes and product-oriented processes in order to deliver a succsefl project

PRoject IN Controlled Envionrment


just know there are two methodologies, one from PMBoK, the other from PRINCE
we only need to focus on PMBoK one though for this course

agile
---
delivers value even if the sys does not include all of the defined requirements

*skip agile manifetso

sprint = 5-7 weeks, working version of the project will be releasd

team learning
---
speed
# of learning cycles completed

depth
degree to which a team can deepen its undertstanding of the proj from cycl eto cycle

breadth
impact the project has on the organization
